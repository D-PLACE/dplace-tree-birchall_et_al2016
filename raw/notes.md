# Notes


## Data:

> A data set of 285 cognate sets of basic vocabulary was compiled using the sources presented in 2 above. The list of
> basic vocabulary is a modified Swadesh 207-word list that combines the meanings included in Swadesh (1952;1955).
> Meanings that are inappropriate for lowland Amazonian societies such as ‘snow’ and ‘ice’ were excluded from
> consideration. A number of meanings in the original list were substituted for similar culturally appropriate concepts;
> ‘year’ was substituted with ‘dry season’, the local convention used to describe the passing of time, and ‘hound’ was
> substituted with ‘peccary’, a local mammal of high importance for sustenance and spiritual life. Two additional meanings
> were added to the list of basic vocabulary: ‘afternoon’ and ‘brocket deer’. Meanings that were not attested in the
> available data, or that were attested only for members of a single subgroup of languages (most often Waric languages),
> were not included in the final list. The final list of basic vocabulary includes 126 meanings

## Analysis:

> To quantify the degree of conflicting signal in these data, we calculated two statistics, the δ-score (Holland et al.
> 2002) and the Q-residual (Gray, Bryant, and Greenhill 2010). These two statistics provide a quantitative measure of how
> much conflict (or reticulation) there is in the network. The mean δ-score for these languages was 0.262 (s.d. = 0.033) and
> the mean Q-residual score was 0.016 (s.d. = 0.004).
